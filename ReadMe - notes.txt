I was not able to use the correct font awsome icons, because the icons that where used in the example where the pro version of the icons, but I did try and use the most relevent font awsome icons that where free.

My preferred method of compilation was css on this occasion.

I would have made the website responsive but given the time allowance i thought it would be best to apply my time in other areas.
